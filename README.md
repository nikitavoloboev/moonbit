## Philosophy

For me, an iPhone is essentially a consumption and communication device. Everything I can do on the phone, I can do faster and better on my MacBook. Thus I find it is valuable to give each of these devices a well defined purpose and use them appropriately.

With all the freedom and power that a smartphone brings, it also brings a lot of **distraction**. There is Twitter, Reddit, Instagram with their endless feeds of streaming live updating content or any other news outlet you prefer to stay on top of things. Staying on top of everything at all times is exhausting and addictive.

I use my phone when I am not using my computer. I use it to send & read messages, make photographs, check & write tasks I have to do, listen to podcasts, music, audio books, read wiki, write quick notes and more. I try to use the best tools that I can to get these tasks completed. And I mindfully spend my time on my phone to make sure I don't waste it.

## Applications

Here is a list of apps that I use the most in my day to day life, sorted by category and their importance.

### Productivity

#### [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/ios/) - Flexible task manager

- My task manager of choice. I [use tags to organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/2do) and work on tasks based on priority.

#### [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone/id718043190?mt=8) - Calendar

- Prefer it to stock calendar app due to a cleaner design and ability to add events quickly with natural language.

#### [Strong](http://strongapp.io) - Workout tracker

- I use it to track my workouts. I have a few custom workouts I made that I can then start and simply follow the exercises and the number of sets for the exercise as my workout progresses.

#### [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) - Habit tracker

- Do something often enough and it becomes a habit. I use the app to track my [essential life habits](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/focusing/habits) I want to complete each day.

### Social

#### [Telegram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810?mt=8) - Messenger

- My favorite messenger and I prefer it over others due its speed, its ability to sync with a native macOS client and the many free and awesome stickers you can use.
- I also use the app to quickly send media/messages between my mac and the phone.

#### [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8) - Twitter client

- My favorite Twitter client. I prefer it over others for its ability to sync timelines with the macOS app and the night theme.

#### [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8) - Reddit client

- My preferred client for browsing Reddit. I love how you can operate the app seamlessly with gestures. I also customized the app to work with my own gestures.

#### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) - Mail client

- My favorite email client that I love due its simplicity of UI and UX as well as separation of emails based on their type (Inbox, newsletters).

#### [Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545) - Team communication

- I only keep essential teams I am signed up on there.

### Photos

#### [Photos](http://www.apple.com/lae/ios/photos/) - Photo library

- The place for all my personal photos/videos synced with iCloud. I love its Memories features.

#### [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8) - Image editor and photo sharing

- Use it to quickly edit photographs I made as I much prefer its filters and editing options than other photo editors. I then post the edited photos I like to Instagram.

#### [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt%3D8) - Photo sharing

- Like it as a way to [share my life](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) through photographs, videos and stories.

#### [Slidebox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slidebox-photo-manager/id984305203?mt=8) - Photo & Album Organizer

- Use the app to quickly delete bad photos and sort photos into albums quickly. I try have all the photos in my Photos library be placed in some folder and this app lets me easily do that.

### Learn

#### [Books](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/)

- Use it to read books (PDF & EPUB). And listen to audio books I downloaded that Audible doesn't have.

#### [V for Wiki](http://v-for-wiki.com) - Wiki reader

- Amazing and beautiful Wikipedia reader. The typography of it and the design makes you explore and easily get lost in reading the wiki.

#### [Medium](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medium/id828256236?mt=8) - Online publishing platform

- Use the app to read articles in night mode.

#### [Trello](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trello/id461504587?mt=8) - Project management tool

- All of my [ideas](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) and goals live on Trello. The app makes accessing [any Trello board I need](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello) quickly.

#### [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) - Audiobooks

- I have low attention span on reading books so listening to audibooks is perfect for me. I listen to either a podcast or an audiobook when I am commuting or doing errands.

#### [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Podcasts

- Lets me listen to the plethora of [podcasts I love](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/podcasts). I love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.

#### [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/) - RSS Reeder

- Use the app to read through my [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) feeds of [blogs I follow](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/research/blogs).

### Utilities

#### [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id568903335?mt=8) - Password manager

- Can't live without the app. It holds all my passwords and anything private so that I only need to remember one thing. My master password. With iOS 12, the app seamlessly integrates with the OS so I can autofill my saved passwords in seconds.

#### [Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739?mt=8) - Cloud Storage

- I store all my documents and files in iCloud, however I love using Google Docs/Sheets for collaborating on documents.

- Use the app to block annoying ads and tracking in Safari.

#### [Bobby](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023?mt=8)

- Use the app to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it at the start of every month and [update my budget](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/finance) for the month accordingly.

#### [Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?ls=1&mt=8) - Recipe manager

### Write

#### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8) - Writing

- I mostly use the app to make edits to my [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). Since the wiki is a bunch of markdown files in a folder that I keep on Dropbox, I can add that folder to Ulysses as external folder and make edits to it.

### Music

#### [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8) - Music streaming

- Prefer using Spotify over Apple Music due to superior music discovery and ability to create and [share playlists](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-playlists) easily.

### Safari Browser

One of the best features of Safari is fast access to bookmarks on opening of new tabs. Here are the ones I use most often on iOS:

## Widgets

Here are the widgets I use:

    <img width="250" helgth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/vF8pmvl.jpg"></a>

I use a `Test` shortcut often to prototype new ideas quickly. I then duplicate the shortcut & give it a name and place it accordingly. I use the same idea of `Test` prototype macro with [Keyboard Maestro macros](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).

![](https://i.imgur.com/8vZ0N10.png)

I use 2 colors for my shortcuts, Grey for ones that are activated from Widgets and Brown for every other shortcut.

### [Scriptable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?mt=8) - Automation using JavaScript

- Lets you write JavaScript code and combine it with Siri Shortcuts. Can even [edit the code on the mac](https://talk.automators.fm/t/code-editing-on-the-mac/2005) and instantly run the shortcuts on the phone.

## Control Center

Here is how my control center looks:

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/5N6ZCM6.jpg"></a>

## WatchOS

I use Apple Watch as a way to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/4JQF26r.jpg"></a>

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/PhpmJud.jpg"></a>

The first watch face is one I am using throughout the majority of the day. It shows the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also lets me quickly start cardio workout (running/biking) or bodyweight workout (with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com)). I can also start a timer or see the time of a timer if one is already running.

The second watch face is one I activate when I want to see the progress on my activity rings. It shows both my activity data & my heart rate.

## iPad

I mostly use my iPad for drawing & sketching with [Procreate](https://procreate.art) & reading books.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="400" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/HkWcjnJ.jpg"></a>

    <img width="400" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/GXQjqv3.jpg"></a>

Most apps on my iPad are the same as ones on my phone. The few apps that are iPad specific are:

- [Procreate](https://procreate.art) - Draw.
- [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/ios/) - Image organizer.

## Games

I don't play games often but the games I do like to play on iOS are usually puzzles.
